This predicted character is then used as the next input to the model.\n\n* At each time step, the updated RNN state is fed back into the model, so that it now has more context in making the next prediction. After predicting the next character, the updated RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns sequence dependencies in the data, as it gets more information from the previous predictions.\n\n![LSTM inference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MITDeepLearning/introtodeeplearning/2019/lab1/img/lstm_inference.png)\n\nComplete and experiment with this code block (as well as some of the aspects of network definition and training!), and see how the model performs.

It's a pretty big accomplishment, and hopefully you have some sweet tunes to show for it.\n\nConsider how you may improve your model and what seems to be most important in terms of performance. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n*  How does the number of training epochs affect the performance?\n*  What if you alter or augment the dataset?\n*  Does the choice of start string significantly affect the result?\n\nTry to optimize your model and submit your best song! **Participants will be eligible for prizes during the January 2025 offering. To enter the competition, you must upload the following to [this submission link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/U8nND6enGjirujVZKX1n):**\n\n* a recording of your song;\n* iPython notebook with the code you used to generate the song;\n* a description and/or diagram of the architecture and hyperparameters you used -- if there are any additional or interesting modifications you made to the template code, please include these in your description.\n\n**Name your file in the following format: ``[FirstName]_[LastName]_RNNMusic``, followed by the file format (.zip, .mp4, .ipynb, .pdf, etc). ZIP files of all three components are preferred over individual files. If you submit individual files, you must name the individual files according to the above nomenclature.**\n\nYou can also tweet us at [@MITDeepLearning](https://twitter.com/MITDeepLearning) a copy of the song (but this will not enter you into the competition)!
